    //what is a programming language
    //human use natural language to interact with each other
    //computer does not understand human language
    //computer only understands 0/1 or on/off (assembly language)
    //programming language is the high level language where we give instructions to a computer
    //instructions tells computer what to do
    //these instructions are called as code
    //compiler converts high level language to low level machine code

    //any solution written in step-by-step instructions procedure is called as algorithm
    //in computer we do everything in a step by step
    //Algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for solving or performing a task


    //what is a syntax
    //structure of word in a sentence
    //rules of the language
    //for programming exact syntax must be followed

    //history of java
    //developed by james gosling
    // was working in sun microsystems
    //was trying to build a vcr
    //used c++ but difficult to manage with c++
    //so created a new language called oak
    //created in year 1995
    //"write once run anywhere"-concept with cross-platform compatibility
    //it converts high level language into a intermediate language which we can distribute and run in any computer
    //we just need jvm to convert the intermediate language into machine code

    //Developed with vision of backward compatibility.should not break with new version release.
    //code written in version 22 can also be run by older versions
    //Coffee - how many times it may become cold and again hot the taste remains the same
    //Java is an island where coffee is grown

    //Java versions
    //1st version in 1995 1.02-was very slow because of on the fly intermediate step-250 classes
    //Java 1.1-500 classes
    //java 1.2-1.4->2300 classes
    //java 1.5 and up java 5.0 -->3500 classes

    //byte code
    //source code -->byte code
    //compiler task was changed from converting code from high level to intermediate language to error checking code validity and
    //converting to an intermediate state
    //jvm is machine-specific
    //byte code converted to machine code with the help of jvm

    //how java changed the internet
    //probability with write once run anywhere
    //security because running on virtual sandbox environmxnt

    //java buzzwords

    //robust -->strong /consistent working
    //java is robust due to strong memory management, exception handling, and type-checking mechanisms each
    // helps in preventing system crashes and ensuring reliable performance.
    //earlier when memory was full, the whole system was getting crashed but now only that instance of jvm gets crashed

    //Multithread
    //Multithreaded
    //computer do everything in step by step manner
    //multithreading in programming is the ability of a cpu to execute multiple threads concurrently
    //allowing for more efficient processing and task management.

    //Architecture Neutral
    //java is architecturally neutral because its compiled code (bytecode) can run in any device with a jvm,regards
    //the underlying hardware architecture.

    //Interpreted and high performance
    //compiled--converted at once
    //interpreted--converted line by line as java is already checked in compiled time so it is executed line by line
    //java combines high performance with interpretability, as its bytecode is interpreted by the java virtual machine
    //which employs just-in-time compilation for efficient and fast execution.

    //distributed
    //java is inherently distributed designed to facilitate network-based application development and interaction,
    //seamlessly integrating with internet protocols and remote method invocation.
